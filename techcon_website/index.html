            <p>TECHCON 2024, a unique celebration of innovation and excellence, took place from September 8-10, 2024, at the 
                Renaissance Hotel in Austin, Texas. This year's conference brought together a diverse group of industry leaders,
                 undergraduate and graduate students, and technical recruiters. It was a platform for exchanging ideas, fostering 
                 collaboration, and celebrating achievements in the semiconductor industry. The conference was distinguished by the 
                 presence of two exceptional speakers who delivered insightful presentations that left a lasting impact on the audience.</p>

                 <p>In her keynote presentation titled "Future Forward: How R&D will Continue to Propel the Semiconductor Industry," 
                    Deirdre Hanford, CEO of Natcast and recipient of the 2025 IEEE Frederik Philips Award, emphasized the pivotal
                     role of the semiconductor industry in driving technological advancements and sustainability. "The semiconductor 
                     industry is not just about technology; it's about people and the impact we can make on the world," Hanford remarked, 
                     emphasizing the human element in the industry.</p>

                     <p>She began by expressing her excitement about addressing a diverse audience, including students and industry veterans, and highlighted 
                        the historical significance of the transistor and its evolution, leading to modern innovations. Hanford delved into the complexity of the 
                        semiconductor industry, discussing the global supply chain, the challenges it faces, and the significant energy consumption of data centers, 
                        emphasizing the need for sustainable solutions. She also discussed the Chips and Science Act, which aims to establish infrastructure and leadership
                         in semiconductor research and development in the United States.</p>

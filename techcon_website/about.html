            <h2>History of TechCon</h2>
            <p>TechCon began as a small gathering of innovators and entrepreneurs in the early 2000s. 
            What started as a local meetup quickly grew into a recognized platform for exploring
             the latest advancements in technology. Over the years, TechCon has expanded from general 
             discussions about emerging tech to specialized tracks covering Artificial Intelligence, 
             Digital Health, Semiconductors, and Deep Tech.</p>

            <p>The evolution of TechCon mirrors the transformation of the technology industry itselfâ€”adapting 
                to challenges, embracing innovation, and empowering visionaries to connect and collaborate. Today, 
                TechCon is an internationally recognized summit that attracts thousands of attendees from across the globe.</p>
